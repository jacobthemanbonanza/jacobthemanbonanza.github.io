<h1>Bananas are the superior fruit</h1>
 <body style="background-color: LightYellow;">
<p>Bananas stand out amongst the other fruits due to it's unique shape and taste, convience, and nutritional benefits from eating it. They are easy to consume on the go, easy to clean up and consume without making a mess, and can fit into many situations. Beyond the quality of it being delicious, they also have qualities that can support daily needs and it's long term help. People of all ages can find bananas as a snack, a fruit, part of a meal, or a way to balance out cramps. With it's long history of becoming one of the most popular items to trade for from Southeast Asia, it holds a strong rooted sentimental value with it too. Since I feel connected to bananas due to my last name having "bonanza", I feel it is right to say I am a banana myself.</p>
